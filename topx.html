                    <p>
                        Far beyond consciousness to the depths of our unconscious brain, our mundane activities are carried out alongside our goals and dreams.
                        <br><br>We are not machines honed to ruthless efficiency; it is our idiosyncrasies and fortunate quirks that instigate art, music, poetry, and an appreciation of beauty and the unusual.
                        <br><br>Designers give life and voice to objects, and along the way they manifest our visions and aspirations for the future, even those we do not yet know we have.
                        <br><br>Developmental and evolutionary innovation arises from the gathering of incremental predispositions that can be shuffled into advantageous configurations.
                        <br><br>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented,
                        fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn’t serve the world. There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to
                        shine, as children do.
